"""C950 - Data Structures & Algorithms II - Performance Assessment

WGUPS Routing Program implementation. Uses a hash table as the self-adjusting
data structure required for storing package data. The algorithm used to plot
truck delivery routes is a greedy algorithm called the "nearest neighbor"
algorithm.
